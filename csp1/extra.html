    <p class="page-extra">
      Guess what! If you're reading this, then you have discovered an Easter Egg!
      The web page was created in compliance to the requirements of the bootcamp training.
      Dubbed as capstone project-1, it is a static webpage developed by applying the learnings from the recent training and exercises.
      Being a static webpage, it only consisted of HTML5 and CSS components but without any frameworks,
      The reason for dropping the framework is to create a very personal touch to the website.
      Minimalist approach with great focus on layouting, typography, simple but elegant, responsiveness
      and to showcase to website audience the ability of the developer to create websites without using frameworks.
      while also showcasing the skills and ability in Frontend Web Development.
      Also, the webpage encourage audiences to be "curious" about the developer who created the website,
      and definitely to be known by most audiences and added through the social media.

      The topic for the capstone-1 is not easy to choose from, there were: Gaming reviews, Infographic material for Voyager spaceprobe, web resume,
      and my prospect project infographics.
      Photography was chosen because aside from the fact that the developer is a photo hobbyist,
      he also wanted to share his photographs in his very own viewfinder (eyes)

      Don't get me wrong, I have no any innate talent for arts...
      I create art with reference to geometry and mathematics,
      thats why there are almost no free-handed drawings/art in the website.
      Lines, right angles, consistency of measurement, squares, and many geometric shapes are featured.
      Borderless elements, monochromatic background, portrait-oriented interface, single handed operation for mobile devices,

      Finally, I feel like I will definitely love being a codeheaded developer!
      Thank you and hope to have collaboration with *YOU* in the future!

      consistent 0 margins and paddings within grid elements
